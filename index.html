    <h1>Intresting Facts about Me</h1>
    <p>I thought it would be fun for you to get to know me a bit outside my technical intrest(maybe not lol).</p>

            <h3>My Favorite Film</h3>
            <p>I am in love with Spider-man Into the Spiderverse. There is something so beautiful about a main stream block buster Film
                that focuses on the celebration of diversity as it showcases many differnt types of people being Spider-man i.e. a hero. The mantra of the Film
                being that "anybody can wear the mask" echoes to reality by insuating that no matter our differnt paths or experinces anybody has the ability 
                to make a differnce. Which is why I cry every time I watch it.

            <h3>My Favorite Sport</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was a kid I have always gravitated more towards Basketball. I played it all the way through 
                middle school. Well, I guess "played" is a strong word. I watched all the talented kids dominate from the bench.
                But on the bright side it incited my passion of watching basketball which is where I thrive. I love watching the NBA. I am a miami Heat fan.
                Although it's been a while since I have sat down to watch a full game, so please don't quiz me.

            <h3>My Deepest Aspiration</h3>
            <p>I have always wanted to create an amazing desert that consists of 2 great food items combained together.
                This seems doable like the person who thought of combining cookies with Ice cream was a genius. I have always said This
                and my family can attest to this by I thought of gogurt before it was a thing. My only idea right now consists of mixing Ice cream
                with rice, which may seem weird at first but I think I can get it to catch on.

            <h3>Original Emblom Creation</h3>
            <p>I started doodling one day and came up with this design. I thought it looked cool in concept
                but I am not a great artist so I could not draw it properly. So I decided to program it instead which
                led to this image.
